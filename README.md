#### [Form teams for me <span>&nbsp;</span><span> &#128512;</span>](https://formteamsforme.netlify.app/)
We have a lot of fun activities that get conducted in our office and the creative team would send out registration forms to all employees. In turn, the team would receive a lot of participation, and as one of the members of the creative team, along with a few other members would spend a lot of time shuffling participants and adding them to the number of teams that would want. Sometimes we would get nominations at the very nth moment and we would have to again spend time thinking where to fit them in the already created teams.


Hence, I thought of building a very simple and user-friendly application that would do this job without any hassle. This would
<p><span> &#9889;<span>&nbsp;</span></span> Shuffle any incoming entry automatically</p>
<p><span> &#9889;<span>&nbsp;</span></span> Every new entry would shuffle the teams</p>
<p><span> &#9889;<span>&nbsp;</span></span> Create teams super fast with evenly distributed participants</p>
<p><span> &#9889;<span>&nbsp;</span></span> Removal of any participant will adjust the teams automatically</p>
<p><span> &#9889;<span>&nbsp;</span></span> Displays the list of extra participants separately</p>
 
Now, all we do is just go to the application do the business in just minutes.<span>&nbsp;</span><span> &#128513;</span>

I welcome any suggestions/ improvements.
